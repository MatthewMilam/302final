// Things that need to be coded

// Things to do before start on 2 player, change the game over logic to fill the board then show game over

// Change main to reassign board when they want to play two player mode

// Superball board with functions
// Note: Main will have to be changed to reassign the board Object to be a 2 player board Object. That will allow the main.js 
// buttons to call functions from the two player mode object instead of the one player mode object. It will also allow us
// to not have to remake all the buttons, and instead just have them call the different functions.

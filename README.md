Final Project: Superball Browser Game
May 9, 2023
This project utilizes the languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make Superball into a playable browser game.
This version will include normal superball as well as a 2-player verison against multiple AI difficulties.
The 2 player version is similar to Superball, but instead each player gets one scoring zone. The player can
move any tiles except those in the other's scoring zone, and can only collect in one's own scoring zone. 2 tiles
spawn on each half of the board, instead of 5 randomly, and the goal is to score more points than your opponent
before your side of the board fills up. Once a player's side fills up, the other player can keep playing on his side
until that fills up. The player with more points scored wins.
